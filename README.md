# Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is my opportunity to sharpen my knowledge on old and new JDK features.

This project contains my Advent of Code solutions, where I follow a few ground rules:
* Solutions are based on Java 24
* Solutions are implemented with JDK features only, including preview features, but no third-party library allowed
* Solutions are executed as JUnit [Parameterized Tests](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-parameterized-tests)

## Execution

Via Maven:

```
./mvnw test
```

or via [your favorite IDE](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#running-tests-ide).
